"""
Team batting and bowling strength features derived from player_stats table.

For each team × season, computes:
  - Top-3 batsmen average (higher → better batting depth)
  - Top-3 bowlers economy (lower → better bowling attack)
  - Batting vs bowling balance score

These are causal features: a team with high batting avg will tend to win.
Unlike win-rate features (which are outcomes), these capture WHY a team is strong.
