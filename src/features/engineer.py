Feature engineering for IPL match prediction.

Features generated per match row (team1 vs team2):
 - Toss win / decision
 - Win percentage: all-time (smoothed), last 3 seasons, last 5 matches
 - Head-to-head win rate (last 3 seasons)
 - Home ground advantage
 - Recent titles (last 5 seasons only)
 - Season form
 - Venue win rate for each team
 - Venue pitch features
